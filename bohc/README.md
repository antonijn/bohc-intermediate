The Intermediate Boh Compiler
=============================

This is (hopefully) the last version of the boh compiler written in C#. It is a complete rewrite of the previous compiler, with the goal of **extreme readability** in mind.

If you wish to contribute, or figure out what the hell is going on inside, I advise you to read the files:

- parsing.md
- codegen.md

They explain (some of) the steps, codenames and initialism used in the compiler.

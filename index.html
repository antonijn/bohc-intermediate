<p>Welcome to the project page for the compiler for the Boh programming language! Boh is a language in many ways designed to be ideal for just about any programmer with a classic object-oriented mind, and manages to do stuff right where a lot of other languages fail.</p>

<h3>
<a name="whats-so-special-about-boh" class="anchor" href="#whats-so-special-about-boh"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's so special about Boh?</h3>

<p>Boh is a language heavily influenced by C# and Java, and any C#/Java programmer will probably feel right at home writing Boh code.</p>

<p>But hold on, Boh isn't just-another-Java-cloneâ„¢, it actually does some things well where C#/Java have failed. Boh is special in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boh has a number of generators, including, but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>A native code generator, via LLVM or C</li>
<li>A JavaScript code generator, for native web applications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boh is designed to both have a comfortable command line interface, and provide easy IDE-integration</li>
<li>Boh is 100% free and open-source, no price, everything is open, anyone can contribute</li>
<li>Boh is more complete than C#/Java were when they were released, allowing for a cleaner standard library</li>
<li>Boh is cross-platform natively, and at the moment supports (at least) Windows and Linux, and many more through JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>If that doesn't make Boh different from C#/Java in the slightest, then I don't know what will.</p>

{"name":"Bohc-intermediate","tagline":"The intermediate boh compiler (still written in C#)","body":"### A Better Language\r\n\r\nWelcome to the project page for the compiler for the Boh programming language! Boh is a language in many ways designed to be ideal for just about any programmer with a classic object-oriented mind, and manages to do stuff right where a lot of other languages fail.\r\n\r\n### What's so special about Boh?\r\n\r\nBoh is a language heavily influenced by C# and Java, and any C#/Java programmer will probably feel right at home writing Boh code.\r\n\r\nBut hold on, Boh isn't just-another-Java-cloneâ„¢, it actually does some things well where C#/Java have failed. Boh is special in the following:\r\n* Boh has a number of generators, including, but not limited to:\r\n  * A native code generator, via LLVM or C\r\n  * A JavaScript code generator, for native web applications\r\n* Boh is designed to both have a comfortable command line interface, and provide easy IDE-integration\r\n* Boh is 100% free and open-source, no price, everything is open, anyone can contribute\r\n* Boh is more complete than C#/Java were when they were released, allowing for a cleaner standard library\r\n* Boh is cross-platform natively, and at the moment supports (at least) Windows and Linux, and many more through JavaScript\r\nIf that doesn't make Boh different from C#/Java in the slightest, then I don't know what will.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
